As a user, I want to be able to associate the same brand of shoes with multiple stores.
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
As a user, I want the price to be in currency format even if I just inputted a number. (In other words, typing in 50 should be updated to $50.00.)
As a user, I do not want stores and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.
As a user, I want all stores and brands to be unique. There shouldn't be two entries in the database for Blundstone.
